He named his shop after his two most popular flavors, saffron and rose.<br><br>Thirty years later, Papen and his uncle run the store and serve more than 50 different flavors of ice cream including lavender, pumpkin, pistachio and cantaloupe.<br><br>Papen said he recalls his grandfather letting him run the register for customers and eat all the ice cream and candy that he could when he was younger.<br><br>"He made me feel like I owned (the shop) for the ten minutes I was there, even though I was only eight years old," Papen said.<br><br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2013/09/b4fa2619-41ff-4429-8704-143b536f7b92-225x300.jpg" width="225"><span class="photocred-inline">Courtesy of Naz Papen</span></div>When Papen grew older, he started taking a more active role in the family business.

"That&#39;s what sets us apart from other ice cream shops ... We want to provide the community a different type of ice cream that you can&#39;t find anywhere."</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1387 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 477-5533</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Sun 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> No alcohol.

Carron said the restaurant is the culmination of a passion for food that dates back to his college days at Macalester College in Minnesota.  &#34;While I was (in college), I started cooking to help pay my bills,&#34; Carron said. &#34;I fell in love with it.&#34; </br></br> Before long, Carron had dropped out of school to pursue a career in the culinary arts, but said he learned the ins and outs of cooking through experience.</br></br> &#34;I couldn&#39;t afford to go to culinary school, but I bought the textbook for the Culinary Institute of America and just cooked everything in it for my college roommates,&#34; Carron said. &#34;I taught myself by working in restaurants and working my way up.&#34;</br></br> <div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/e8651b2a-680f-4fdd-92ca-6767dd1b3ad6-300x197.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Daily Bruin file photo</span></div> Carron was then employed as a chef under celebrity restaurateur Michael Mina in San Francisco. It was during this time that Carron said he discovered a love for Neapolitan pizza, a thin, crispy pie topped with various fresh ingredients, and imagined a restaurant revolving solely around the idea.</br></br> &#34;I was researching Neapolitan pizza and discovered that it cooked in one minute,&#34; Carron said. &#34;That&#39;s when I had this lightning bolt moment, like, &#39;Wow, if I can cook a pizza in one minute, what&#39;s to stop me from setting it up like an assembly line?&#39;&#34;</br></br> Carron said he tried to bring the fine dining experience from Mina&#39;s restaurant to 800 Degrees&#39; faster, casual atmosphere by sourcing fresh ingredients, such as broccolini and artichokes from local farmers.</br></br> The main goal of the cuisine, Carron said, was to make a pizza that was freshly prepared and satisfying, yet healthy and light.</br></br> &#34;It&#39;s the kind of pizza that doesn&#39;t weigh you down afterwards; it&#39;s light and you can eat a whole one, go back to work and not want to take a nap,&#34; Carron said. &#34;I just hope (the customers) feel happy and healthy after they eat a pizza here.&#34;</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 10889 Lindbrook Dr, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 443-1911</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Sun 11 a.m. to 2 a.m.</li> <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li> <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $$</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> No alcohol.

While most guests departed at reasonable hours, one by the name of Bob Jaffe refused to leave.</br></br>Jaffe had just bought a corner shop bakery in the heart of Westwood Village, and was set on showing it to his friend. Berman eventually gave in and went down to see the shop in the middle of the night.</br></br>Berman, who himself was already in the bakery business, said he knew Jaffe was bringing him down to the shop to convince him to go into business together. Berman said he remained skeptical up until they stepped into the shop.</br></br>&#34;It was the middle of the night and (Jaffe) brought me into this tiny little shop right here. Then I knew I&#39;d be making doughuts for a long time,&#34; Berman said.</br></br>On the spot, the two became business partners and opened their establishment as the Corner Shoppe Bakery the very next morning.</br></br> Throughout the years, there have been three generations of Bermans working behind the cozy bakery counter selling the large variety of signature doughnuts Stan&#39;s has to offer. Yet, neither Berman&#39;s children, nor his grandchildren wanted to stay in the bakery business long-term, so Berman himself continues to come into work every day.</br></br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/5d7b5ea6-a5be-4364-aa21-8475d2f416ac-300x236.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Neil Bedi / Daily Bruin senior staff</span></div>With about half a century under his belt, Berman has said he&#39;s gotten to know a number of the UCLA chancellors, professors and students. For a long time, he said he had a good partnership going with the school and was selling about 150 dozen donuts per day to campus.</br></br>Among these hundreds of doughnuts sold, the Huelle stands out as Stan&#39;s Donuts&#39; No. 1 seller. The pastry is popular for its creamy peanut butter center and decadent chocolate glaze. Berman, however, said his favorite to this day continues to be the classic buttermilk raisin bar.</br></br>As the university has evolved to become a more independent entity from Westwood village, Berman has said the partnership he once had with UCLA has since dwindled, but he continues to have a loyal customer base with certain organizations and students.</br></br>Now, on the brink of the shop&#39;s golden anniversary, Berman said he&#39;s watched the university grow and change, but two things are constants in Westwood: his donuts and the character of the students.</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 10948 Weyburn Ave, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 208-8660</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Sun 6 am - 12 am</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: Yes</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Street parking.

Students and Westwood natives alike had come to check out the new hot dog place. Despite an hour-long fryer break down, the crowds remained and returned for a second day as well.</br></br>For owner Gary Budish, the opening of the restaurant was a dream he realized post-retirement. Budish, who considers himself a businessman, said the restaurant business wasn&#39;t something he ever really envisioned himself pursuing, but that when he retired he found himself unsatisfied without any work to do.</br></br>Only two months into his retirement, Budish discovered the original Fab Hot Dogs through the Food Network show &#34;Diners, Drive-in&#39;s and Dives.&#34; Blown away by the food, it took him only a year to become friends with the owner Joe Fabrocini, secure the rights to Fab Hot Dogs and get right to work in Westwood.</br></br><div class="thumbnail with-caption"><img src="http://dailybruin.com/images/2013/10/a90e0ffc-63a8-4aef-9946-6946ec5dfb77-300x218.jpg" width="300"><span class="photocred-inline">Kelsey Rocha / Daily Bruin</span></div>Budish and his life-long friends Loren Harmell and Andy Fox co-own the business with Fabrocini acting as a consultant. Because none of the three have any restaurant experience, their roles revolve more around controlling the quality of the food and in building the Fab Hot Dog experience for customers. It isn&#39;t uncommon to see them hustling about the restaurant.</br></br>Fox said while they opted to replicate a lot of Fab&#39;s original concept, they sought to modernize it and create an atmosphere that would appeal more to college students. With patio seating, rustic brick walls and brightly colored decor, the restaurant captures a fresh diner-fusion look.</br></br>Harmell said another youthful component is the restaurant&#39;s &#34;I Ate It All&#34; challenge. Customers who successfully eat their way through every item on the menu earn themselves a spot on the wall of fame. That means challengers are looking at trying 19 types of hot dogs, 14 different burgers and a multitude of crispy, fried sides among other Fab Hot Dog delicacies.</br></br>The proximity to UCLA is something the owners are all excited about. Budish said they have planned late hours Thursday through Saturday hoping to be the go-to hang out for post-game celebrations.</br></br>Budish, who has a particular affinity for UCLA sports, said he is a close personal friend to a number of directors in the athletic department, and said having their flagship store in Westwood is an especially rewarding experience.</br></br>&#34;I&#39;m a big sports donor through the Wooden Athletic Fund. I never miss a basketball game; I never miss a football game,&#34; Budish said. &#34;I support the school whole-heartedly and it&#39;s a dream to have a location that is this close to the school.&#34;</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 920 Broxton Avenue, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 794-0333</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Wed 11 am - 10 pm</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thu 11 am - 12 am</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri 11 am - 1 am</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat 12 pm - 1 am</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun 12 pm - 8 pm</li> <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: Yes</li>          <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> No Alcohol.

It&#39;s used to celebrate and to mourn. It&#39;s really neat to see how it touches people,&#34; Cancelosi said. &#34;It&#39;s really a place to commune.&#34;<br/><br/>Napa Valley Grille, an asset of the Tavistock Group, opened in Westwood in 2000. Boudreax said as a social chef he was immediately drawn to the company for its emphasis on creating an intimate dining experience.<br/><br/>&#34;We firmly believe we&#39;re giving a personal experience, and what&#39;s more personal than food,&#34; Boudreaux said. &#34;There&#39;s a ton of blind faith in the guys behind the (kitchen) counter – that they&#39;re going to do right by you before they put it down in front of you. It&#39;s a leap of faith.&#34;<br/><br/>Boudreaux said their high-class New American menu seeks to serve the needs of guests with locally sourced, farm-to-table, seasonal cuisine. Quality proteins such as roasted chicken, grilled fillet mignon and pan seared duck are among the dinner selections, while the lunch menu boasts a variety of burgers, sandwiches and salads.<br/><br/>For Cancelosi, he said capturing a Napa moment with the atmosphere and flavors of the food is what sets the restaurant apart in the Los Angeles area.<br/><br/>Both Boudreaux and Cancelosi make a daily habit of circulating through the dining room and getting to know the guests. They both agree that they spend more time in the restaurant than at home and have expanded their definitions of family to include the staff of the restaurant as well as its guests.<br/><br/>&#34;(Napa Valley Grille) is an extension of your home family. In fact, I celebrated Christmas in the restaurant and brought my kids down,&#34; Cancelosi said. &#34;I opened the restaurant up to the staff and anyone else who wanted to come down for a glass of wine from 3-5. We&#39;re really all in this together.&#34;</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1100 Glendon Ave. #100, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 824-3322</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Thu 11:30 am - 3 pm, 5:30 pm -<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9:30 pm</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri 11:30 am - 3 pm, 5 pm - 11:00 pm</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat 11 am - 3 pm, 5 pm - 11 pm</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun 11 am - 3 pm, 5 pm - 9 pm</br></li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $$</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Valet parking. </li><li><i class="icon-globe"></i> <a href="http://napavalleygrille.com" target="_blank">www.napavalleygrille.com</a></li></ul></div></div>'

Langford helped his wife, Sam, open the shop after they made the transition from Seattle to Southern California.<br><br>&#34;The beans we use, (which are from) Espresso Vivace, we drank &#46;&#46;&#46; everyday,&#34; said Langford. &#34;When we moved to (Los Angeles) there was nothing but Coffee Beans and Starbucks&#39;, so we thought this would probably do pretty well.&#34;<br><br>It was first known as West Burton Coffee and Tea, after a village in England, but later the name was changed to Espresso Profeta, a reference to David Schomer. Also, who roasts the Espresso Vivace beans and has been regarded as the &#34;prophet of coffee.&#34; Other than the fact that the new name just sounded good in Italian, it also caused business to double, Langford said.<br><br>&#34;Putting the Espresso sticker on the window made people who would just walk by finally decide to come in,&#34; he said, comparing the phenomena to the conclusion of a restaurant makeover TV show.<br><br>Today, drinks such as the White Velvet, Flat White, Nico and Chai Tea are among the most popular menu items, served alongside with many pastry options, including a distinctive green-colored lemon and blueberry scone.<br><br>The baristas at Espresso Profeta specialize in embellishing their drinks with latte art, a method of combining milk with espresso to create a decorative design on foam and a skill that Langford said takes at least six months of training to master.<br><br>The espresso and the food, as well as the artistic garden setting and red brick walls of the cafe, attract a wide variety of customers, from students to professionals to everyday families, some of whom have spent years coming to the cafe.<br><br>&#34;It&#39;s neat watching families grow &#46;&#46;&#46; We&#39;ve (also) helped a lot of people through their four years of school,&#34; said Langford, witness to studious college students becoming lawyers and silent infants becoming chatty four-year-olds.<br><br>And with this in mind, every day from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., the owners and employees of Espresso Profeta work diligently to provide customers with the cup-licking taste that keeps them coming back.</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1129 Glendon Avenue, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 208-3375</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Sun 7 am - 7 pm</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $$</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Street parking. </li><li><i class="icon-globe"></i> <a href="http://www.espressoprofetala.com" target="_blank">http://www.espressoprofetala.com</a></li></ul></div></div>'

With a shared laugh, the co-founders of fundamental LA begin to share the story behind their restaurant&#39;s success.<br><br>"The idea behind fundamental was to take our love for hospitality and good food, technique and seasonality, and be our own destination among the many chain stores in Westwood," Lee said.<br><br>Southern California natives Lee and Faust first met in the second grade. After working in business management for three years, the UC Berkeley graduates decided it was time for a change. A few post-work drinks at The Surly Goat bar later, the concept of fundamental LA was born.<br><br>Initially reluctant about the cramped storefront on the corner of Westwood Boulevard and Wellworth Avenue, Lee and Faust said they saw a certain potential in the restaurant. Together, the team redesigned the tight space to fit fundamental&#39;s intimate, contemporary aesthetic.<br><br>When bar stools were out of their price range, Lee and Faust improvised. What started out as a series of sketches is now a fully upholstered series of bar stools made of plywood. A closer look reveals a vibrant red found on the underside of the seats; a secret touch that mimics the bottom of a Louis Vuitton shoe.<br><br>"It was a labor of love. It was frustrating and extremely time-consuming, but we saved money, and now there&#39;s a cooler story to tell," Faust said.<br><br>Fundamental LA opened its doors on June 13, 2011, and sits a few blocks away from the chain restaurants in Westwood Village.<br><br>"There are a lot of cheap, fast eats but not a lot of made-from-scratch cooking in sort of an upscale environment, which is what we are," Lee said.<br><br>To this day, Lee and Faust said they feel that the need for wholesome food is still extremely apparent in Westwood. A plethora of fresh herbs and seasonal vegetables appear on the menu, but they saidit&#39;s the farmer-chef relationships that make each meal at fundamental stand out.<br><br>"We go to the Santa Monica Farmers Market and forge these incredible conversations with some of the best food producers in the country. It&#39;s an opportunity to connect with the people who are growing the food, and it&#39;s a privilege to get to use their food," Faust said.<br><br>"There&#39;s a friendly food vendor there named Barbara who always remembers my name! And I have a (hard)name to remember," Lee said with a laugh.<br><br>It is this connection to the origins of their produce that fundamental LA thrives upon and hopes to show in their dishes. The restaurant also gives customers the chance to provide their own fresh ingredients.<br><br>"Neighbors even bring in huge bags of limes, fresh figs and avocados from their gardens, and have it cooked in the restaurant," Faust said.<br><br>Fundamental&#39;s sandwiches are what started it all, and the duo said choices like the albacore tuna sandwich remain a huge hit with customers.<br><br>"We use sashimi grade, fresh albacore that comes in daily. There&#39;s no mayo in the sandwich - we just toss it with olive oil and capers vend, avocado, sundried tomato, olives - and it&#39;s fresh and delicious," Lee said.<br><br>For dinner, Lee and Faust suggest the simple purity of the carrot risotto. The brussels sprouts drizzled with tom yum glaze are a popular dish that they saidadds an Asian influence to the menu.<br><br>The duo also recommends fundamental&#39;s freshly made vanilla cream soda, which they both said students especially will love.<br><br>"It&#39;s a house-made vanilla ice cream mixed with soda water and heavy cream, stirred up as a legitimate light, fluffy milkshake. Also the churros. You can&#39;t go wrong with the churros," Faust said.<br><br>As the business partners rapidly share items from their menu in bursts of passion, the topic shifts to what&#39;s in store for the future of fundamental LA.<br><br>"We&#39;re actually opening another fundamental, so that&#39;s top of the line for us right now. It&#39;s basically like what we do at lunch, but it won&#39;t be in Westwood, it will be further east," Lee said.<br><br>With abundant energy and an armful of seasonal produce, the duo anticipate a new chapter for fundamental LA will begin no later than mid-2014.</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1303 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 444-7581</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Tue-Fri 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tue-Thu 5:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri-Sat 5:30 p.m. to 11 p.m.</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $$</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Street parking.</li> <li><i class="icon-globe"></i> <a href="http://www.fundamental-la.com/" target="_blank">www.fundamental-la.com</a></li></ul></div></div>'

One week later, he decided that he was going to make crepes.<br><br>Fathi is the 28-year-old owner of Westwood&#39;s Mon Amour Cafe, which opened in February. Mon Amour Cafe offers everything from the classic strawberry Nutella crepe to more original options such as the Reese&#39;s Peanut Butter Cup crepe or the filet mignon with blue cheese, sautéed mushrooms and caramelized onion crepe.<br><br>Fathi worked in the restaurant industry for over 10 years, first as a busboy, then a waiter and finally a manager.<br><br>"I never thought to open up a creperie before, but I knew I wanted to do something sweet," Fathi said. "And I had some friends who were recently in Paris and they talked a lot about crepes."<br><br>To get inspired for his cafe, Fathi walked all around Westwood to explore the different types of food offered.<br><br>"I realized students didn&#39;t have many options as far as quick, sweet things," Fathi said. "I felt like a creperie would be a good addition to the village."<br><br>Once he settled on crepes, Fathi brought in a specialist to show him how to make the French sweet. Fathi experimented with different recipes and created the menu himself.<br><br>His personal favorite is the s&#39;mores crepe - a concoction of marshmallow cream, Nutella, cinnamon graham crackers, French vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and powdered sugar.<br><br>"It&#39;s like camping without any of the setup," Fathi said.<br><br>Mon Amour Cafe now offers macaroons, which are baked at night and rotate through 35 different flavors. Fathi&#39;s current favorite is the seasonal pumpkin spice macaroon.<br><br>Fathi said Mon Amour Cafe keeps late hours to accommodate Bruins. The cafe&#39;s earliest closing time is midnight, but it often stays open later.<br><br>"We never turn down customers," Fathi said. "On Thursday you might get a rush at 11:50 (p.m.), so I&#39;ll be here till 1:30 a.m. on those days."<br><br>Although students are its main fare, Mon Amour Cafe is sometimes visited by celebrities as well.<br><br>"We had (Metta World Peace) from the Lakers," Farthi said. "He practiced making crepes for all his friends one night here. We ended up making them for him."<br><br>Fathi said seeing positive customer reactions is the most satisfying part of his job.<br><br>"It&#39;s so rewarding to see students come in, happy that we&#39;re here," Fathi said. "&#39;Mon amour&#39; means &#39;my love&#39; in French. I wanted people to feel the love when they came in."</div><div class="span4">  <ul class="icons-ul"><li><i class="icon-map-marker"></i> 1303 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles</li>         <li><i class="icon-bell"></i> (310) 444-7581</li>         <li><i class="icon-calendar"></i> Mon-Thu 10:30 a.m. to 12 a.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fri 10:30 a.m. to 3 a.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sat 11:30 a.m. to 3 a.m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sun 12 p.m. to 12 a.m.</li>  <li><i class="icon-briefcase"></i> Delivery: No</li>        <li><i class="icon-tag"></i> $</li>         <li><i class="icon-info-sign"></i> Street parking.</li> <li><i class="icon-globe"></i> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MonAmourCafeWestwood" target="_blank">www.fb.com/MonAmourCafeWestwood</a></li></ul></div></div>'
