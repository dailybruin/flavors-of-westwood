One (UCLA alum) came and asked, &#39;Do you guys make the fat cordon blue down here?&#39;" Capek said. "He was so excited that we did because it wasn’t on the menu here."<br><br>Other customers have left their own mark on the menu. One of the sandwiches, the Fat Jaime, has been named by the only person to have eaten the "Big Fat Fatty" sandwich, a 27 inch sub that weighs 10 pounds.<br><br>But Capek said the best part is seeing people enjoy your food.<br><br>"We have a passion for the food there.
